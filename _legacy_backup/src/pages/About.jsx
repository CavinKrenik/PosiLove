        PosiLove is a dating community for people living with chronic STIs — and for anyone who believes that
        honesty, empathy, and safety matter more than stigma.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">
        We know how heavy disclosure anxiety can feel. How many swipes turn into nothing the moment you share your
        status. How easy it is to believe you&apos;re the only one. You&apos;re not.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">
        PosiLove was built to flip that script: a place where your status isn&apos;t a secret weapon waiting to
        blow up your love life, but just one part of your story — held with care, protected with encryption, and
        surrounded by people who get it.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">
        Our job is not to tell you how to date. Our job is to give you a safer, kinder container to do it in.
